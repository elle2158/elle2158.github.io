      PixieWorks by Elle (“we,” “us,” or “our”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, share, and safeguard the personal information you provide when you visit our website, sign up for our newsletter, or otherwise interact with us.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      When you subscribe to our email updates or contact us, we collect the personal details you provide—such as your name, email address, mailing address, and phone number. We also gather usage data automatically, including your IP address, browser type, operating system, referring URLs, pages visited, and the dates and times of those visits. In addition, we use cookies and similar tracking technologies to recognize your device, remember your preferences, tailor content, and analyze site performance.
    </p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>
      We use your personal information to deliver the services and information you request, to respond to your questions, and to send you newsletters or marketing materials when you have opted in to receive them. Usage and cookie data help us understand how people interact with our site so we can continually improve our content, design, and user experience. You will always have the option to unsubscribe from marketing emails using the link provided in each message.
    </p>

    <h2>3. How We Share Your Information</h2>
    <p>
      We never sell or rent your personal data to third parties. We may share information with trusted service providers who perform functions on our behalf—such as hosting, email delivery, analytics, and customer support—and who agree to keep your information confidential. We may also disclose your information if required by law, to enforce our terms and policies, or to protect our rights, property, or safety, as well as that of our users or others.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
    <p>
      Our website uses cookies to distinguish you from other users, to remember your preferences, and to collect aggregated usage statistics. You can control cookie settings through your browser preferences or opt out of certain analytics services, but disabling cookies may limit some features of our site.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      We employ industry-standard technical and organizational measures—such as encryption, firewalls, secure servers, and access controls—to protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. Although no method of transmitting data over the Internet is completely secure, we strive to safeguard your personal information to the fullest extent possible.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Our services are not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from any person under the age of 13. If you believe we have inadvertently collected data from a child under 13, please contact us immediately so we can delete that information.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>
      Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the right to access, correct, update, or delete your personal information. You may also have the right to withdraw consent for data processing or to object to certain uses of your data. To exercise any of these rights, please contact us using the details below.

      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or applicable laws. When we do, we will revise the “Last updated” date at the top of this page. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.
